## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Light theme only (no toggle) — MVP simplicity
- Fully neutral palette (no accent color) — Ollama aesthetic
- Next.js + Tailwind over Astro — future product pages expansion
- No contact form — email + LINE sufficient
- One-page scrolling layout — MVP ships fast
- Used Geist Sans (Next.js 16 scaffold default) — satisfies sans-serif requirement, zero extra config
- Used max-w-5xl (1024px) for content width — midpoint of 900-1100px spec range
- Font CSS variable applied to <html> not <body> — required for @theme scope

### Pending Todos

None.
