<objective>
Create all 7 content section components for the Nexto single-page site.

Purpose: These are the core content blocks that visitors see when scrolling the page. All are static server components with no client-side interactivity (except Hero which imports the existing Button component).

Output: 7 section component files in `src/components/sections/`, each with an `id` attribute for anchor navigation.

  </files>
  <action>
Create directory `src/components/sections/` if it does not exist.

**Hero.tsx** — Server component (no 'use client' directive). Must contain:
- `<section id="hero">` wrapper
- Inner container: `mx-auto max-w-5xl px-6 py-20` (generous vertical padding per user decision)
- `<h1>` with text "Nexto" (the h1 style is already set in globals.css to text-4xl font-semibold)
- `<p>` subtitle: "Enterprise software studio."
- Two body lines as separate `<p>` elements:
  - "We build systems that run in production."
  - "From pilot to rollout."
- Two CTA buttons using the existing `Button` component from `@/components/ui/Button`:
  - "Contact" — wrap Button in an `<a href="#contact">` tag, OR render Button as a link. Since Button is a `<button>` element, wrap it: use an anchor tag styled like the button. Actually, the simplest approach: create anchor elements styled identically to Button. Use `<a href="#contact" className="inline-flex items-center justify-center rounded-full border border-neutral-200 bg-white text-neutral-900 px-6 py-2 text-sm font-medium transition-colors duration-150 hover:bg-neutral-100">Contact</a>`. Same for Products with `href="#products"`.
  - This avoids nesting `<a>` inside `<button>` (invalid HTML). The Button component is a `<button>`, but CTAs need to be anchor links for smooth scroll.
- Body lines in `text-neutral-600` for slightly muted tone
- Subtitle in `text-neutral-500`
- Spacing: `space-y-4` or similar between text elements, `mt-8` before buttons, `flex gap-4` for button row
- Hero text should scale down on mobile: use `text-4xl md:text-5xl` on h1 (override the global h1 size for hero specifically)

**WhatWeDo.tsx** — Server component. Must contain:
- `<section id="what-we-do">` wrapper
- Inner container: `mx-auto max-w-5xl px-6 py-20`
- Section heading: `<h2>What we do</h2>`
- 3-column grid: `grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-3 gap-8` (stacks to single column on mobile, no 2+1 intermediate — per user decision)
- Three blocks with these exact titles and descriptions:
  1. **Build** — "Custom systems tailored to how your business operates."
  2. **Deploy** — "Cloud or on-premise. We handle infrastructure so you don't have to."
  3. **Support** — "Ongoing maintenance, monitoring, and iteration after launch."
- Each block: `<h3>` for title, `<p className="text-neutral-600">` for description

**Focus.tsx** — Server component. Must contain:
- `<section id="focus">` wrapper
- Inner container: `mx-auto max-w-5xl px-6 py-20`
- Section heading: `<h2>Focus</h2>`
- 3 items (can be `<ul>` with `<li>` or separate `<div>` blocks). Copy:
  1. **Reliability** — "Systems that stay up when it matters."
  2. **On-premise** — "Deployments that meet data residency requirements."
  3. **Security** — "Built with compliance and access control from day one."
- Style each item with bold title and muted description, generous spacing between items

All three components: NO 'use client' directive. Pure server components. Export as named exports.

  <done>
Hero.tsx renders H1 "Nexto", subtitle, two body lines, and two anchor-styled CTA buttons pointing to #contact and #products. WhatWeDo.tsx renders 3-column grid with Build/Deploy/Support. Focus.tsx renders 3 items about reliability/on-prem/security. All are server components with section IDs.

**Products.tsx** — Server component. Must contain:
- `<section id="products">` wrapper
- Inner container: `mx-auto max-w-5xl px-6 py-20`
- Section heading: `<h2>Products</h2>`
- 3 cards in a responsive grid: `grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-3 gap-8`
- Each card: `border border-neutral-200 rounded-lg p-6` (MUST use explicit border-neutral-200 per TailwindCSS v4 — default border color is currentColor, not gray)
- Card content for each:
  1. **Endyra** — "Workflow orchestration for regulated industries."
  2. **Manverra** — "Manufacturing execution and traceability platform."
  3. **Careyra** — "Patient management for clinics and hospitals."
- Each card has: `<h3>` title, `<p className="text-neutral-600">` description, and a "View" link
- "View" link: Render as `<span className="text-sm text-neutral-400">View</span>` (non-interactive, since product pages don't exist yet — per Claude's discretion, this is cleaner than a disabled link)
- Side-by-side layout on desktop per user decision (the 3-column grid achieves this)

**HowWeWork.tsx** — Server component. Must contain:
- `<section id="how-we-work">` wrapper
- Inner container: `mx-auto max-w-5xl px-6 py-20`
- Section heading: `<h2>How we work</h2>`
- 4 numbered steps as a vertical list with large decorative numbers per user decision:
  1. **Understand** — "We start by listening. What does your operation actually need?"
  2. **Prototype** — "A working pilot in weeks, not months."
  3. **Deploy** — "Roll out to production with monitoring from day one."
  4. **Iterate** — "Continuous improvement based on real usage data."
- Use `<ol>` with items showing large numbers: `<span className="text-5xl font-semibold text-neutral-200 leading-none select-none tabular-nums w-12 shrink-0">` for the number, then title + description in a flex layout per research Pattern 7
- After the steps, tagline: `<p className="mt-12 text-neutral-500 italic">Small pilots over big promises.</p>`

**About.tsx** — Server component. Must contain:
- `<section id="about">` wrapper
- Inner container: `mx-auto max-w-5xl px-6 py-20`
- Section heading: `<h2>About</h2>`
- Company name: "Nexto Co., Ltd." (can be a `<p>` with font-semibold or another `<h3>`)
- Description: "A small team focused on shipping stable software."
- Keep it minimal — just these two lines with appropriate spacing

**Contact.tsx** — Server component. Must contain:
- `<section id="contact">` wrapper
- Inner container: `mx-auto max-w-5xl px-6 py-20`
- Section heading: `<h2>Contact</h2>`
- Instruction line: "Get in touch to discuss your project."
- Email link: `<a href="mailto:info@nexto.co.th" className="underline hover:text-neutral-600">info@nexto.co.th</a>`
- LINE link: `<a href="https://line.me/R/ti/p/@nextocompany" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="underline hover:text-neutral-600">@nextocompany</a>` — must open in new tab with noopener noreferrer
- Display links clearly, each on its own line or in a vertical list with labels like "Email" and "LINE"

All four components: NO 'use client' directive. Pure server components. Export as named exports.

Run `npx tsc --noEmit` to confirm no TypeScript errors. Verify all 7 section files exist: `ls src/components/sections/`. Check that Products.tsx contains `border-neutral-200` (not bare `border`): `grep "border-neutral-200" src/components/sections/Products.tsx`.
  </verify>
  <done>
Products.tsx shows 3 bordered cards with product info and non-interactive View text. HowWeWork.tsx shows 4 numbered steps with large decorative numbers and the tagline. About.tsx shows company name and team description. Contact.tsx shows instruction line, clickable mailto email link, and LINE deep link opening in new tab. All are server components with section IDs.
