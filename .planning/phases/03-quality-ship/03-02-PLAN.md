<objective>
Create the /privacy page with a concise, professional privacy policy.

Purpose: The site uses Google Analytics and must disclose data collection practices. The footer already links to /privacy — this plan creates the page it points to.
Output: A working /privacy route with privacy policy content.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Create /privacy page with privacy policy content</name>
  <files>src/app/privacy/page.tsx</files>
  <action>
    Create `src/app/privacy/page.tsx` as a standard Next.js App Router page.

    **Page metadata** — Export a `Metadata` object:
    - `title: 'Privacy Policy — Nexto'`
    - Optionally `robots: { index: false }` to keep privacy page out of search results (Claude's discretion — either is fine)

    **Page structure:**
    - Include Header and Footer components (import from `@/components/layout/Header` and `@/components/layout/Footer`) so the privacy page has consistent site navigation
    - Main content area: `<main className="mx-auto max-w-3xl px-6 py-24">`
    - Use semantic HTML: h1 for "Privacy Policy", h2 for subsections, p for paragraphs
    - Style headings and text consistently with the rest of the site (neutral-900, appropriate font sizes)

    **Content requirements** (per user decision):
    - Language: English only
    - Must mention: Google Analytics data collection, cookies used by GA, that no personal data is collected beyond analytics
    - Tone: Professional but concise — NOT a legal wall of text
    - Claude drafts the content — keep it to ~200-300 words total
    - Suggested sections: What data we collect (GA pageviews, anonymous usage), Cookies (GA cookies explained briefly), Third-party services (Google Analytics with link to Google's privacy policy), Contact info (info@nexto.co.th)
    - Include an "Effective date" or "Last updated" line at the bottom

    **Important:** The Footer already has `<a href="/privacy">Privacy</a>` — this page must render at /privacy for that link to work. For static export, the page will be built as `out/privacy.html` (or `out/privacy/index.html`).

    **Note on Header behavior:** The Header component has scroll-spy and hash navigation for the main page sections. On the /privacy page, the nav links (Products, Process, Connect) will point to `#products`, `#process`, `#connect` which don't exist on this page. This is acceptable for MVP — clicking them will navigate to the main page with the hash (standard browser behavior with static export). Do NOT modify Header for this.
  </action>
  <verify>
    Run `npm run build` — must complete without errors. Check that `out/privacy.html` or `out/privacy/index.html` exists in the build output. The file should contain "Privacy Policy", "Google Analytics", and "cookies" text.
  </verify>
  <done>
    /privacy page exists, builds successfully, contains privacy policy mentioning Google Analytics and cookies in a concise professional format. Footer link to /privacy resolves to this page.
  </done>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
- `npm run build` completes without errors
- Privacy page HTML exists in `out/` directory
- Content includes: "Google Analytics", "cookies", contact email
- Page has Header and Footer for consistent navigation
</verification>

<success_criteria>
/privacy route renders a concise, professional privacy policy page that mentions Google Analytics data collection, cookies, and provides contact info. Build succeeds. Footer link works.
</success_criteria>

After completion, create `.planning/phases/03-quality-ship/03-02-SUMMARY.md`
